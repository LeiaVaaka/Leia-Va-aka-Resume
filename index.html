    <p>"I've spent my career as a fixer and a learner, drawn to roles where I can understand a complex system and make it run better—whether that system was a bank's cash flow, a concrete plant, or a national crisis helpline. I've always advanced by identifying bottlenecks and training others. Now, I'm applying that same pattern to technology. I'm building web applications, which are just another kind of system to optimize. My unique value is that I don't just see the code; I see the end-user, the business logic, and the potential points of failure, because I've been on the operational front lines for decades."</p>
